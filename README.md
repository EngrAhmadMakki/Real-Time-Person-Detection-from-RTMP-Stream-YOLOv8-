# 🎥 Real-Time Person Detection from RTMP Stream (YOLOv8)

This project uses **YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)** and **OpenCV** to detect people in real-time from an **RTMP video stream**.  
The program captures frames from a live video feed, runs **object detection** to count persons, and saves the results as an annotated video.

## 🚀 Features
- 📡 Connects to an **RTMP live video stream**  
- 🧠 Uses **YOLOv8 nano model** for fast object detection  
- 👤 Detects and counts **persons in real-time**  
- 🖼️ Draws bounding boxes around detected persons  
- 💾 Saves the processed output as a 20-second video in `results/output.mp4`
