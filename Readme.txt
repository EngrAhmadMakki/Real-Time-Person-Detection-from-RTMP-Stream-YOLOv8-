YOLOv8 Person Detection - Results

This folder contains the output video generated by the YOLOv8 person detection script.

File: output.mp4
Duration: 20 seconds
Resolution: Same as the original RTMP stream
Frame Rate: ~10 FPS (adjustable in the script)

Description:
The video displays real-time person detection from a live RTMP stream using the YOLOv8 model.
Each frame shows bounding boxes around detected persons and the total person count overlaid
in the top-left corner.

How it works:
- Frames are captured from the RTMP stream.
- The YOLOv8 model detects objects in each frame.
- If a "person" (class ID 0) is detected, a green box is drawn.
- A text label shows the number of persons in the frame.
- All processed frames are compiled and saved as a video.
